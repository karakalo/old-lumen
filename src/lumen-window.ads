   -- Create a native window, with defaults for configuration intended to
   -- create a "usable" window.  Details about the parameters are:
   --
   -- Win: Object into which the new window's handle will be stored.
   --
   -- Parent: Handle of an existing window that will act as the new window's
   -- parent, or No_Window, meaning an independent top-level window.
   --
   -- Width, Height: Window dimensions in pixels.
   --
   -- Events: Set of events this window wishes to receive.
   --
   -- Name: Name associated with new window, often displayed in the window's
   -- title bar.  If blank, the executable's filename is used.
   --
   -- Icon_Name: Name associated with the window's icon.  If blank, the
   -- executable's filename is used.
   --
   -- Class_Name, Instance_Name: Together these make up the window's "class".
   -- If blank, the class name is set to the executable's filename with
   -- initial capitalization; the instance name is set to the executable's
   -- filename.
   --
   -- Context: An existing GL rendering context to be used in the new window,
   -- or No_Context, meaning a new context is created for the window.
   --
   -- Depth: The color depth of the GL rendering context, either true-color or
   -- indexed/pseudo-color.
   --
   -- Direct: Whether you want direct rendering or server-based rendering.
   --
   -- Animated: Whether the GL rendering context will be double-buffered, thus
   -- allowing smooth animation.
   --
   -- Attributes: The various graphic display ("visual") attributes which can
   -- be set.  The defaults work for most modern systems.
